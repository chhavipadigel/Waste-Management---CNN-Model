# Week-1
This project preprocesses and visualizes a waste classification dataset for image classification. Images are loaded using OpenCV, converted to RGB, and stored in a DataFrame with labels. A pie chart shows label distribution, forming a foundation for building a CNN model with TensorFlow and Keras.
